#If you're running a Windows OS and running via a .js file you'll need to set the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE prior to calling the script via node.

Example in cmd: SET UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=2 && node my-file-to-run.js (no spaces around the =)

Or in Powershell: $env:UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 2 && node my-file-to-run.js

***Why ???? If You don't set this env variable, limited to a threadpool of 4 threads, which is the default size of the threadpool.***
